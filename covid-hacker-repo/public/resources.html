            COVID-19 is the disease caused by the new coronavirus that emerged in China in December 2019.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>COVID-19 symptoms include cough, fever, shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, unexplained loss
            of
            taste or smell, diarrhea and headache. COVID-19 can be severe, and some cases have caused death
          </li>
          <br />
          <li> The new coronavirus can be spread from person to person. It is diagnosed with a laboratory test.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li> There is no coronavirus vaccine yet. Prevention involves frequent hand-washing, coughing into the bend of
            your elbow, staying home when you are sick and wearing a cloth face covering if you can't practice social
            distancing.

          </li>
          <br />

        </h5>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <br />

    <h1> How does the new coronavirus spread? </h1>
    <br />


    <h5 class="text-left">As of now, researchers know that the new coronavirus is spread through droplets released into
      the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The droplets generally do not travel more than a few feet, and
      they fall to the ground (or onto surfaces) in a few seconds — this is why social and physical distancing is
      effective in preventing the spread.</h5>
    <br />

    <h1> How did this new coronavirus spread to humans?</h1>
    <br />


    <h5 class="text-left">COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, a city in China, in December 2019. Although health officials are
      still tracing the exact source of this new coronavirus, early hypotheses thought it may be linked to a seafood
      market in Wuhan, China. Some people who visited the market developed viral pneumonia caused by the new
      coronavirus. A study that came out on Jan. 25, 2020, notes that the individual with the first reported case became
      ill on Dec. 1, 2019, and had no link to the seafood market. Investigations are ongoing as to how this virus
      originated and spread. </h5>

    <br />
    <h1>What are symptoms of COVID-19?</h1>
    <br />


    <p><h5 class="text-left">COVID-19 symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cough</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Muscle aches</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Unexplained loss of taste or smell</li>
        <li>Diarrhea</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        In rare cases, COVID-19 can lead to severe respiratory problems, kidney failure or death.
        If you have a fever or any kind of respiratory difficulty such as coughing or shortness of breath, call your
        doctor or a health care provider and explain your symptoms over the phone before going to the doctor’s office,
        urgent care facility or emergency room.
        If you have a medical emergency such as severe shortness of breath, call 911 and let them know about your
        symptoms.

    <h1> How is COVID-19 diagnosed?</h1>
    <br />


    <h5 class="text-left">Diagnosis may be difficult with only a physical exam because mild cases of COVID-19 may appear
      similar to the flu or a bad cold. A laboratory test can confirm the diagnosis.

    <br />

    <h1> How is COVID-19 treated?</h1>
    <br />

    <h5 class="text-left">As of now, there is not a specific treatment for the virus. People who become sick from
      COVID-19 should be treated with supportive measures: those that relieve symptoms. For severe cases, there may be
      additional options for treatment, including research drugs and therapeutics.
    </h5>
    <br />

    <h1> How do you protect yourself from this Coronavirus?</h1>
    <br />

    <h5 class="text-left">It’s crucial to practice good hygiene, respiratory etiquette and social and physical
      distancing.

    <h1> How medical students can stay safe from Coronavirus?</h1>
    <br />

    <h5 class="text-left">Medical students who are still interacting with patients and who might encounter those with
      COVID-19 infections should keep safety guidelines in mind, experts say.
      Rodney Rohde, a medical laboratory professional who specializes in virology and has an education-related Ph.D.,
      says medical students should meticulously go through all the sanitation rules they are supposed to follow so that
      they can rely on that knowledge during a crisis.
      "In general, the best way for all of us to remain calm is to be prepared," Rohde, a former public health official
      for the state of Texas, wrote in an email. "Understanding the institution's policies around infection prevention
      and control is critical."

      Medical students also need to safeguard their mental and spiritual health, Waggoner says, because it is hard to be
      compassionate toward others without self-compassion. Meditation might be useful, she suggests, and med students
      who are religious might find a sense of peace through prayer.
